## Module Overview

### Customer Ordering Module

Responsibilities

* QR access verification
* menu browsing
* cart management
* upsell suggestions
* order generation

---

### Shop Dashboard Module

Responsibilities

* menu management
* QR generation
* shop configuration

---

### Admin Module

Responsibilities

* analytics
* platform-wide oversight

---

## Logistics Hub Module (NEW)

Responsibilities:

* **Regional Hubs**: Management of physical distribution nodes for multi-city pickups.
* **Rider Dashboard**: Task-focused interface for last-mile delivery agents.
* **Order Batching**: Grouping multiple orders into single routes to maximize efficiency.
* **Dispatch System**: One-click shop-to-courier handoff protocol.

---

## Global Search & Discovery (NEW)

Responsibilities:

* **Full-Text Search (FTS)**: O(log n) product discovery using Postgres GIN indexes.
* **Cross-Tenant Cataloging**: Scalable searching across multiple shop instances.
* **Weighted Matching**: Prioritizing product titles over descriptions for high-relevancy results.

---

## Security Model

Menu access requires:

1. Valid QR entry
2. Active session
3. Optional location verification

Session expiration:

```
30 minutes
```

---

## Scalability Strategy

Initial deployment supports:

```
100–500 shops
```

* **GIN Indexing**: Real-time Full-Text Search for thousands of items.
* **Hierarchical Routing**: Distributed pickup nodes to reduce bottlenecking.
* **Domain Trust Boundary**: Hardened QR redirection to prevent open-relay attacks.
